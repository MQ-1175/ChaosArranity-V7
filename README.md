# ChaosArranity
A mod that adds a few items and liquids, and a whole new tier of upgrades, along with arc. Made by Chickenloser and Oreo with help from Duvent.

Adds 95 new blocks, 5 items, 2 liquids, and 31 units, with plans to add even more.

The mod is not done yet and we are aware of the spriting issues.
